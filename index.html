<h1><head>Welcome to my personal world.</head></h1>
In this kind of world you don't get harassed
nor punished, or get trashtalked constantly.
<br>
Here, <strike>justice</strike> does <b>not</b> exist.
<br>
Here, <strike>mean people</strike> do <b>not</b> exist.
<br>
Here, you <b>don't</b> have to worry about <span>anything</span>.
<br>
in this world, you can just do whatever the FUCK you want to.
<br>
nothing's preventing you to go to my personal world, I encourage everything :p
